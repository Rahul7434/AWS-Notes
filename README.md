# AWS-Notes
### What Is AWS Cloud?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is like a powerful toolbox on the internet.
Companies use it to build websites, store data, run apps, and much more—without needing physical servers.

### Client-Server Model
Imagine you’re using a banking app on your smartphone:
You (Client): Open the app to check your balance, transfer money, or pay bills.
Bank’s Server (Server): Stores all the data, processes your requests, keeps your account info secure.
Every time you tap a button, your phone sends a request to the bank’s central server. That server does the work (like checking your balance) and sends the result back to your app. 🏦📲

🕸️ In Cloud Computing
Now, imagine that server isn’t in one physical bank location—it’s in the cloud, managed by platforms like AWS:
The cloud makes it scalable (can serve millions of users).
It’s available 24/7, backed by data centers worldwide.
Easy to update and secure.
💡 Key Insight
One server, many clients. You don’t need your own server at home. You simply connect and use the service—fast, secure, and convenient.

🌐 What Is Cloud Computing?
Think of cloud computing like ordering food from a restaurant instead of cooking at home:
You don't need a kitchen (servers).
You just order what you need, and the restaurant (cloud provider) delivers it.
You pay only for what you eat — not for the whole kitchen setup.

💻 In Tech Terms
Cloud computing means:
You use computing power, storage, apps, etc. over the internet.
No need to buy expensive hardware or install software manually.
Services come from big cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

💰 Pay-as-You-Go = Smart Spending
Instead of buying a full server that may sit unused:
You pay only when you run something.
No hidden costs. No overpaying.
Super helpful for startups and businesses that want flexibility.

✨ Real-Life Examples
Watching Netflix? The videos stream from the cloud.
Uploading pics to Google Photos? That’s cloud storage.
Using Gmail or Outlook? Your emails live in the cloud.

### Deployment Models 
```
There are three different kinds of deployment 
models: 
1. Cloud-based 
2. On-premises 
3. Hybrid
☁️ Cloud-Based Deployment
Services are hosted entirely on the cloud.
You access everything via the internet.
No need to buy or manage your own physical hardware.
Real-life example: A startup hosts its website on AWS, stores files in Google Drive, and uses Salesforce CRM — all cloud-based.

🖥️ On-Premises Deployment
Everything runs on servers located within your organization.

You buy and maintain your own hardware and infrastructure.

Offers complete control, but requires more effort and cost.

Real-life example: A hospital stores patient data on its internal servers to follow strict privacy rules and regulations.

🔄 Hybrid Deployment
Mix of cloud + on-premises.

Critical data stays in-house, while less-sensitive tasks run on the cloud.

Offers flexibility and balance.

Real-life example: A bank keeps customer transaction records on-site but uses the cloud for mobile banking apps and email services.
