# AWS-Notes
### What Is AWS Cloud?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is like a powerful toolbox on the internet.
Companies use it to build websites, store data, run apps, and much more—without needing physical servers.

### Client-Server Model
Imagine you’re using a banking app on your smartphone:
You (Client): Open the app to check your balance, transfer money, or pay bills.
Bank’s Server (Server): Stores all the data, processes your requests, keeps your account info secure.
Every time you tap a button, your phone sends a request to the bank’s central server. That server does the work (like checking your balance) and sends the result back to your app. 🏦📲

🕸️ In Cloud Computing
Now, imagine that server isn’t in one physical bank location—it’s in the cloud, managed by platforms like AWS:
The cloud makes it scalable (can serve millions of users).
It’s available 24/7, backed by data centers worldwide.
Easy to update and secure.
💡 Key Insight
One server, many clients. You don’t need your own server at home. You simply connect and use the service—fast, secure, and convenient.
