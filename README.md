# AWS-Notes
### What Is AWS Cloud?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is like a powerful toolbox on the internet.
Companies use it to build websites, store data, run apps, and much more—without needing physical servers.

### Client-Server Model
Imagine you’re using a banking app on your smartphone:
You (Client): Open the app to check your balance, transfer money, or pay bills.
Bank’s Server (Server): Stores all the data, processes your requests, keeps your account info secure.
Every time you tap a button, your phone sends a request to the bank’s central server. That server does the work (like checking your balance) and sends the result back to your app. 🏦📲

🕸️ In Cloud Computing
Now, imagine that server isn’t in one physical bank location—it’s in the cloud, managed by platforms like AWS:
The cloud makes it scalable (can serve millions of users).
It’s available 24/7, backed by data centers worldwide.
Easy to update and secure.
💡 Key Insight
One server, many clients. You don’t need your own server at home. You simply connect and use the service—fast, secure, and convenient.

🌐 What Is Cloud Computing?
Think of cloud computing like ordering food from a restaurant instead of cooking at home:
You don't need a kitchen (servers).
You just order what you need, and the restaurant (cloud provider) delivers it.
You pay only for what you eat — not for the whole kitchen setup.

💻 In Tech Terms
Cloud computing means:
You use computing power, storage, apps, etc. over the internet.
No need to buy expensive hardware or install software manually.
Services come from big cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

💰 Pay-as-You-Go = Smart Spending
Instead of buying a full server that may sit unused:
You pay only when you run something.
No hidden costs. No overpaying.
Super helpful for startups and businesses that want flexibility.

✨ Real-Life Examples
Watching Netflix? The videos stream from the cloud.
Uploading pics to Google Photos? That’s cloud storage.
Using Gmail or Outlook? Your emails live in the cloud.
